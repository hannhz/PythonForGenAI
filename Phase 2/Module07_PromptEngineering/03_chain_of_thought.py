# Module 07 - Prompt Engineering
# 7.4 Chain-of-Thought Prompting
# Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting asks the model to reason step by step before
# giving a final answer. It consistently improves accuracy on tasks requiring
# multi-step reasoning - math, logic, planning.
#
# NOTE: This script makes REAL, billed API calls to Anthropic. It requires a
# valid ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in a .env file in this folder to run.
